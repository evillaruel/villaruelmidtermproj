                        Since its initial release in 2014, Vue.js has grown to be one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of components which enable developers to create concise modules to be used and re-used throughout their application. UI Libraries are collections of these modules that implement a specific style 
                        guideline and provide the necessary tools to build expansive web applications.
